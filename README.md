# Stocks Evaluation: Predicting Future Trends in the Stock Market

## Overview 

Problem Statement: An Investor with a portfolio containing 3 stocks (Netflix, Blackberry, and Google) would like to know based on past closing prices if they should hold, sell or purchase more shares in their portfolio for the future. 

Based on historical data, we will utilize the daily price of the stock at close to predict the next days closing price in order to help new investors make a decision using machine learning model LSTM for future predictions. 

The reason why we selected our topic is due to the ever changing circumstances in the market that make it hard for traders to predict when the best time to buy or sell is. Having historical data from over 10+ years will help us evaluate previous data in order to predict future trends in the market for the stocks selected. This will help our investors decide the best time to buy and sell the specific stocks selected. 

### Source of Data

We will be utilizing stocks from 3 companies from Yahoo Finance as the source of data. We have exported data with maximum history to evaluate daily open and close price. The stocks we are evaluating using the model are Google, Netflix, Blackberry. The reason we chose these stocks is because we wanted to utilize stocks that have been around for a very long time and can show trends through out different periods having gone through different environmental and financial changes.  

- Below is a screenshot of the conceptual diagram of the of the 3 companies data.

A few questions we hope to answer as we examine this data are:

1) Is this stock volatile?
2) How long should the stock be held for?
3) When is the right time to purchase the seleced stock?
4) When is the best time to sell the selected stock?
5) How does this stock compare to others?
6) Are there current environmental constraints affecting the stock price compared to previous years?
7) What are other factors affecting the stock price in the time period evaluated?

### Communication Protocols: 

To communicate effectively we will utilize Slack App and make notes and discussion points on this channel. We will also utilize class time to discuss the next steps and main ideas before weekly submissions. We realize that we will need time outside of class to get together as a group, and for that we will meet on Microsoft Teams weekly. 

Below is a rough summary of when we will meet and what the point of that meeting will be:

* Tuesday - Class (Discuss progress for weekly submission that is due Thursday and have 60-80% of the work completed for each segment)
* Wednesday - Microsoft Teams Meeting at 8:00pm EST (Finalize submission details that is due next day; Submit if possible tonight or before class Thursday)
* Thursday - Class (Discuss the next segment and roles; Where help and focus is needed, who will be working on what portion, etc.; Create a date to have such accomplished task done)
* Sunday - Microsoft Teams Meeting at 8:00pm EST (Progress meeting; Discuss if anyone needs help with role before Tuesday's Class Meeting)
